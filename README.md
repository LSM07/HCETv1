# HCETv1
HCETv1 (c) 2015 Lee Mullenbrock and is liscenced under the MIT license. 
MidiDotNet (Midi.dll) (c) 2009 Tom Lokovic is also licensed under the MIT license.

HCETv1 is meant to be an extension of the Charlie Banacos-style 
ear training. Exercises can be single-note lines, individual chords, or 
multiple intervallic chords and is meant to test people without perfect pitch. 
Exercises can be anywhere from 1 to 12 notes (beats) long and can have up to 6 
voices. Every additional voice added is placed in a lower octave; there will 
never be voice-crossing between 2 octaves as to not confuse the student.


These are Windows-only as of right now. You can either choose to install
the program or just run it as it is. If you do choose to not install it,
make sure the midi.dll is in the same folder as the exe so that it will
run properly.
